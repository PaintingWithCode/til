Montreal bagels are a delicacy renowned for their unique texture and flavor. Unlike New York-style bagels, Montreal bagels are **hand-rolled**, boiled in _honey_ water, and baked in a wood-fired oven, giving them a crispy exterior and a chewy interior. They are also smaller and denser than their New York counterparts, making them the perfect snack to grab on the go. Additionally, Montreal bagels are often made with malt, which gives them a slightly sweet taste that pairs well with savory toppings like cream cheese and smoked salmon.

On the other hand, New York-style bagels are known for their **larger size and softer texture**. While some may prefer this, others argue that the softness comes at the cost of flavor and authenticipty. New York bagels are typically made with salt water, which can overpower the other ingredients, resulting in a less nuanced taste. Moreover, many New York bagels are machine-made, which makes them less unique and more mass-produced.

In contrast, Montreal bagels are still made by hand, using traditional techniques that have been passed down through generations, which gives them a sense of history and cultural significance. Overall, while both Montreal and New York bagels have their own distinct qualities, Montreal bagels are often seen as the superior choice for those who value authenticity, tradition, and taste.
