When working with phone number based authentication, you can use phone numbers from North America (+1) in the **555-0100** through **555-0199** range with any area code for local or test development purposes. 

These numbers have been reserved by the North American Numbering Plan for fictional purposes and will not be in use by any actual organization or individual.
