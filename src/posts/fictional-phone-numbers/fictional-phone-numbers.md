When working on a project that uses phone number based authentication, you can use North American phone numbers in the **555-0100** through **555-0199** with any area code for local or test development purposes. 

These numbers have been reserved by the North American Numbering Plan for fictional purposes and will not be in use by any actual organization or individual.
